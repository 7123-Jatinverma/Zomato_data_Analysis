India is renowned for its diverse range of cuisine available across numerous restaurants and hotel resorts, showcasing a reflection of unity in its diversity. The restaurant industry in India is in a constant state of evolution. There's a growing trend among Indians to embrace restaurant dining, whether through in-person experiences or food deliveries. With an increasing number of restaurants across every state in India, there's a keen interest in exploring data to gather insights, fascinating facts, and figures pertaining to the food industry in each city.
